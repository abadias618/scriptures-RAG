user : What examples of the Lord’s mercy have you seen in the Book of Mormon?
assistant : Examples of the Lord's mercy in the Book of Mormon include the reassurance of Nephi, who highlights that the tender mercies of the Lord are over those He has chosen, granting them deliverance (1 Nephi 1:20). Additionally, Mormon expresses joy in the Lord's long-suffering and mercy, believing that the people could become righteous again (Mormon 2:12). Another instance is found in Alma 18:41, where a plea for mercy acknowledges the abundant mercy previously shown to the Nephites. Finally, in Helaman 15:12, it is noted that despite their afflictions, the Lord will remain merciful to the Lamanites.

user : What are spiritual gifts? Who are they given to? Why are they given? How do we receive them?
assistant : Spiritual gifts are special abilities given by the Spirit of God to individuals for the benefit of the community. They are given to believers according to God’s will and serve various purposes, such as healing, prophecy, and teaching. We receive these gifts through the Holy Spirit, often as a manifestation of faith or through God's grace, allowing us to serve and uplift one another in our spiritual journeys.
